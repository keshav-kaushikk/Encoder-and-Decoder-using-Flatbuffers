# Encoder and Decoder using FlatBuffers

Encoder and Decoder implementation using FlatBuffers for efficient data serialization and deserialization.

## Introduction

This project provides a simple implementation of an Encoder in C++ to serialize data into FlatBuffers binary format and a Decoder in Python to decode the binary data and print the information.

## Features

- Serialize data into FlatBuffers binary format (Encoder - C++).
- Decode FlatBuffers binary data and print information (Decoder - Python).
- FlatBuffers schema file (.fbs) for defining the client data structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- FlatBuffers library installed. Follow the [FlatBuffers installation guide](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_building.html) for instructions.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keshav-kaushikk/Encoder-and-Decoder-using-Flatbuffers.git
   cd Encoder-Decoder-FlatBuffers
   ```

## Usage

To compile the C++ Encoder and generate a FlatBuffers binary file:

1. **Compile and Run C++ Encoder**
2. **Run Python Decoder**
